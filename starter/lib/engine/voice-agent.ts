// Tier 2, the voice agent (ticket 12). When keypad answers are not enough the call
// moves to tier 2 and the callee talks (push-to-talk on the phone page). Each turn:
//
//   1. the ear (a transcription model) writes down what the callee said, and, at the
//      same time, the audio model (audio in, audio out) answers them aloud from a short
//      brief (not the case file);
//   2. the checker (Haiku, through the ModelGateway) reads the transcript against the
//      brief's facts and the policy and writes the structured result: claims, changes
//      the callee asked for, conflicts with the records, whether the agent's reply is
//      allowed, and whether to go on, end resolved or hand over;
//   3. the agent says the audio model's reply when the checker allows it and the call
//      goes on; otherwise it says the checker's own reply through text to speech.
//
// Fallback: when the audio model fails (or none is configured), the ear listens, the
// checker decides and writes the reply, and text to speech speaks it.
//
// Simulated calls talk too, in text: a model plays the callee (simulated-person.ts) and
// its words go straight to step 2 ("text" path). No ear, no audio model, no speech; the
// checker writes every reply, exactly as in the fallback.
//
// The opener: the agent does not start from zero. It says what it already knows (the
// order, the keypad answers, why the call escalated) and asks one specific question. The
// checker's model writes it from the brief; a template stands in when that fails.
//
// The voice agent gathers information only. It never agrees to a change: a change
// the callee wants becomes a change proposal (needs the operator's yes) when the call
// ends, and what they said becomes the call result (engine `callEnded`).
