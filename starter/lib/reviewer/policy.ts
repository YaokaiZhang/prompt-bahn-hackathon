// The approval policy (PRD §7.1, ADR 0001): contact type × action type -> acts alone,
// needs a yes, or propose only. This table is the one source: the reviewer's prompt,
// its `get_policy` tool and the finding check read it, the engine turns findings into
// proposals with `policyFor`, and the Rules page renders it.
//
// Adding a row: give it an id, the contact types and action type it covers and a
// decision; `policyFor` must still find exactly one row for every contact type and
// question or change (the engine's proposal tests check that). `renderPolicy` (the
// prompt) reads only id, contact, action and decision of the reviewer's rows, so the
// other fields can change without changing the reviewer's prompt or its cached reviews.
// A row marked `reviewer: false` (pickup-readiness) is engine-only: it governs the
// rules' planned calls and never reaches the prompt or the policy_row enum.
