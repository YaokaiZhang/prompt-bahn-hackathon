# Car Delivery Control Room

A control room where people and agents work together to get cars delivered, built for Bahn's challenge at the Prompt Operations Hackathon (24–25 Oct 2026). The product plan is in [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md).

All data is fictional. Nothing real is connected.

## Layout

- `dataset/data/`: the fictional snapshot (100 orders), as JSONL. `dataset/SCHEMA.md` explains every field.
- `attachments/`: fictional documents, receipts and photos, with `manifest.json`.
- `starter/`: the Next.js, TypeScript and Postgres app.

## Run

You need Node.js 24+ and Docker.

```sh
cd starter
cp .env.example .env
npm ci
docker compose up -d --wait
npm run db:push
npm run db:seed
npm run attachments:seed
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000.

The seed does not run the reviewer. With `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set, review a few orders with
`npm run review:sweep -- CD-420516 CD-420437`, or opt in to the full one-time sweep of every order
(it calls the model on all 100) with `npm run db:seed -- --review`.

For a live demo, run `starter/scripts/start.sh --demo`. It does everything above, then reviews
the demo orders (only the ones not reviewed yet call the model) and resets the demo clock to 09:00.
Run it again just before the demo starts. The Site and Driver teammates should open the phone page
only when the demo reaches their call: a call rings out 30 s after the page opens.
