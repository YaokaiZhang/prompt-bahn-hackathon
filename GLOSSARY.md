# Car Delivery Control Room

The place where Bahn operators and agents work together to get every car delivered. Agents check orders, ask the cheap questions, and bring an operator only the decisions that need a person.

## People and parties

**Operator**:
A Bahn operations staff member who reviews agent work and makes decisions in the control room.
_Avoid_: Admin, operator manager, user

**Customer**:
The party that pays Bahn for an order (`orders.customer_id`), usually a dealer.
_Avoid_: Buyer, client, account, persona

**Customer side**:
The customer, any contact the customer gave us on the order, and any site the customer owns. The agent never contacts the customer side; it only proposes contact to an operator. One exception (ADR 0001 amendment): a pickup-readiness call to the order's pickup place or pickup contact, even when that is a customer-owned site or a contact the customer gave us. The paying customer is never called.

**Driver**:
The freelance driver assigned to move the car.

**Seller**:
The party responsible for releasing the car at pickup: its readiness, papers and keys.
_Avoid_: Pickup place, site (a site is a place, not a party)

**Persona**:
A demo login role (Operator, Site, Driver) that decides which screen a person sees. A persona is not a party to the order.
_Avoid_: Customer, user type

## Places

**Endpoint**:
An order's pickup or delivery point, with its address, access instructions and contact. It may be a private address with no site.
_Avoid_: Pickup place, location, stop

**Site**:
A managed place profile (dealership, source dealer, storage or transfer yard) with standard hours, rules and a contact email that an endpoint may point to.
_Avoid_: Place, branch, location

## Checking

**Rule check**:
A deterministic test over an order's records that passes, fails, or can't be evaluated.
_Avoid_: Flag, alert, validation

**Strong rule**:
A rule check whose failure puts the order in front of an agent or operator on its own.

**Couldn't-check item**:
A known gap in an order's records (for example, no pickup contact on record) that is listed openly but does not by itself make the order need action.
_Avoid_: Warning, weak flag

**Reviewer**:
The LLM agent that reads one order's records and looks for information that conflicts or is wrong.
_Avoid_: Document reviewer agent, checker

**Finding**:
One conflict the reviewer found, citing the records that disagree and the record that names who to ask.
_Avoid_: Issue, flag, conflict report

**Alert**:
A signal recorded in the dataset that is a reason to look, not a diagnosis. Not produced by the control room.
_Avoid_: Flag, finding

**Checked normal**:
An order whose rule checks passed and whose records the reviewer read without finding a conflict.
_Avoid_: Quiet, no alert, OK

## Order groups

**Problem**:
The group of orders the agent cannot move forward alone: they wait on an operator's decision or contact.
_Avoid_: Needs action

**In progress**:
The group of orders where an agent action is running or waiting on a reply.

**Normal**:
The group of orders that are checked normal and not finished.

**Solved**:
The group of orders not published yet where the agent's calls settled the open points and the operator has not confirmed the call results yet. Shown as "Fixed, review it", both as its tag and as its pipeline stage. Orders on the market or on the road are never Solved.
_Avoid_: Done, resolved

**Finished**:
The group of orders that are finished completely: delivered or cancelled, with nothing open.
_Avoid_: Done

## Publishing

**Fixed, review it**:
The tag and pipeline stage of a Solved order: the agent fixed it, and the operator checks it before it is published. The operator reads each rewrite and the call transcripts; their approval confirms the changes and publishes the order.

**Pipeline**:
Every order by stage: Unpublished, Fixed, review it, Finding a driver, Driver assigned (booked or moving), Done (delivered or cancelled). Its state (Problem, Fixed, review it, In progress, Normal) is a small tag on the card.

**Rewrite**:
One call result shown as before (what the records said) and now (what the person said on the call), with the call's transcript.

**Published**:
On the driver market (Finding a driver), by the agent for a reviewed Normal order, or by the operator.
_Avoid_: Posted, listed

**Demanding job**:
A job on the market that is cross-country, needs more than 12 hours of driving, or needs a ferry or train between the endpoints. The demand filter decides it before drivers see the job.

**Travel plan**:
The travel planner's rough suggestion for a demanding job: getting to pickup, a hotel when needed, ferry or train tickets, the way home, against the order's travel budget. Nothing is booked.
_Avoid_: Booking, itinerary
_Avoid_: Delivered (a delivered order can still have gaps)

## Agent work and decisions

**Proposal**:
Something an agent wants to do or change, with its evidence, who pays, and the policy row that applies, waiting for an operator's decision.
_Avoid_: Suggestion, recommendation, action item, task, to-do
A proposal moves through proposed, approved, answered and dismissed. It stays one proposal throughout. **Answered** means the question it asked got its answer: the operator recorded the customer side's answer (customer-side contact), the operator answered their own question (operator question), or the agent's call carrying it ended with a result (call). A change proposal is never answered: its yes commits it.

**Approve**:
An operator's yes on a proposal. On a change proposal it writes an effect event; on a customer-side proposal it hands the contact to the operator.
_Avoid_: Accept, confirm, sign off

**Policy row**:
One line of the approval policy that says, for a contact type and action type, whether the agent acts alone, needs a yes, or may only propose.

**Instruction**:
An operator's direction to the agent, saved on a proposal, explaining how to act differently.
_Avoid_: Comment, note, feedback

**Effect event**:
The append-only record of something committed on an order, layered over the snapshot. A change to the order (a contact confirmed or changed, a window moved, a cost approved) is written only after an operator's yes; the operator's own answers are committed when given. A call result and a reported ETA are written by the agent at once, without a yes, because they are attributed statements (what the person said on the call), not changes to the order. Proposal text is never a fact; an effect event is.
_Avoid_: Update, change, mutation, operational event (that is the dataset's history)

**Snapshot**:
The fixed dataset as of 2026-10-21T09:00Z. Effect events are layered on top of it, and it is never edited.

**Demo clock**:
The control room's notion of "now", starting at the snapshot time and moved forward only on purpose.

## Calls

**Call**:
A mock phone contact by the agent with a site or driver, run in tiers from cheapest to most expensive.
_Avoid_: Contact (broader), phone task

**Tier**:
One level of a call: 1 is fixed keypad questions, 2 is the LLM voice agent, 3 is handover to an operator.

**Handover**:
The end of a call that the voice agent couldn't resolve, giving an operator the transcript, a summary, the open question, and a proposed next step.
_Avoid_: Escalation, transfer

**Callback**:
A later call the agent scheduled because nobody answered or the person was busy.

**Next check**:
A follow-up time already recorded in the snapshot from earlier work, such as a site call due at 10:00. It is not a callback; the agent did not schedule it.
_Avoid_: Callback, reminder

**Reported ETA**:
A new arrival time the driver states on a call, recorded at once as a time attributed to the driver. It replaces the tracking estimate as the current ETA. It is the driver's statement, not a change to the order: the delivery promise stays the customer's.
_Avoid_: New window, rescheduled delivery, updated promise

## Summaries

**Digest**:
A scheduled summary in the Briefing inbox, with counts taken from rule checks and prose written by an LLM.
_Avoid_: Report, email, summary email

**Urgent push**:
An immediate template-only notice that an order became urgent or a handover arrived.
_Avoid_: Alert, notification
